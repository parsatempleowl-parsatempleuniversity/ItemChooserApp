## Programming Language and Development Environment
Programming Language: Java

Development Environment: Android Studio

## Project Abstraction
This Android mobile application allows the user to select an item from the list of items in order to see a description for that chosen item. The item description shows the item's name, item's image, item's price, and item's price plus tax. This Android Mobile Application can be used in both portrait mode and also can be used in landscape mode. This Android Mobile Application also allows the user to get back to the list of items in the portrait mode.

## Project Relevance
The goal of this Android mobile application is Test Driven Development. The reason for it is that it was being tested via emulator in Android Studio as I was designing it, building it, and running it. Android Studio made Test Driven Development a lot easier since it allows me to use its emulator as a testing tool for my Android mobile application. I used its emulator a lot to test to see how its portrait and landscape layouts actually looked in the actual Android mobile application and it was used heavily here.

## Conceptual Design
This Android mobile application can be used both in portrait mode and also can be used in landscape mode. The reason for it is that I have made both a portrait orientation layout and a landscape orientation layout for the page with the description of the selected item to be used with it. I have made a ItemListFragment that displays the list of items for the user to chose from. I have made a ItemDetailsFragment that displays the description for the item that was chosen by the user from the list of items. The item's name, item's price, and item's price plus tax all have been hard coded by me. The tax rate that I have chosen for its price plus tax is 10.00%. This Android Mobile Application have been tested throughout its own creation using the emulator in Android Studio to make sure the design of this Android mobile application is exactly what I wanted to be.
